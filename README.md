# AI-Powered Web Research Agent

This Python script implements a basic web research agent that uses Google's Gemini AI models to analyze user queries, simulate web searches and content extraction, analyze the relevance of information, and synthesize a research report.

**Disclaimer:** This version heavily relies on **mock components** for web searching and scraping. It does *not* perform live web searches or scrape real website content beyond generating simulated data. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the workflow and the integration of AI for analysis and synthesis tasks within a research pipeline.

## Features

*   **Query Analysis:** Uses Gemini AI (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) to understand the user's query type (factual, exploratory, news-related), extract key search terms, and determine if news results are relevant.
*   **Simulated Web Search:** Uses a `MockSearchTool` to return predefined, fake search results.
*   **AI-Generated News Aggregation:** Uses Gemini AI (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) to generate realistic-sounding (but fake) news headlines and snippets relevant to the query, or provides hardcoded mock news as a fallback.
*   **Simulated Web Scraping:** Uses a `WebScraper` that *does not* actually fetch web content. It generates mock page titles and paragraph content based on the URL structure and only simulates checking `robots.txt` for `example.com`.
*   **Content Relevance Analysis:** Uses Gemini AI (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) to score the relevance of (simulated) content against the original query. Includes a basic keyword-based fallback.
*   **Key Point Extraction:** Uses Gemini AI (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) to extract key points from the (simulated) content relevant to the query. Includes a basic sentence-matching fallback.
*   **Report Synthesis:** Uses a more powerful Gemini AI model (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`) to generate a structured research report (Executive Summary, Key Findings, Analysis, Conclusion) based on the analyzed (simulated) content. Includes a basic fallback report structure.
*   **Modular Design:** Code is organized into classes representing different tools (Search, Scraper, Analyzer, Aggregator, Agent).
*   **Error Handling:** Includes basic `try...except` blocks for API calls and provides fallback mechanisms.

## Important Limitations (Current Version)

*   **No Real Web Search:** Uses `MockSearchTool` which returns hardcoded fake results.
*   **No Real Web Scraping:** The `WebScraper` generates fake content and only pretends to check `robots.txt` for `example.com`. It does not interact with the live web.
*   **AI-Generated News:** News articles are generated by the AI or are hardcoded mocks, not fetched from real news sources.
*   **API Key Hardcoded:** The Gemini API key is currently hardcoded in the script. **This is insecure and should be changed immediately.**
*   **Basic Fallbacks:** Fallback mechanisms for AI errors are rudimentary.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install google-generativeai requests beautifulsoup4
    ```
    *(Note: `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` are included as they are typical for web scraping, even though the current mock scraper doesn't fully utilize them).*

3.  **Configure API Key (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Obtain a Gemini API Key:** Get your key from Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
    *   **Remove Hardcoded Key:** Open `run_cleaned.py` and **delete** the line:
        ```python
        GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSyApaOx0102nb1qqOnFLRPpccOo-GLSeWq0" # DELETE THIS LINE
        ```
    *   **Use Environment Variables (Recommended):**
        *   Set an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key.
            *   **Linux/macOS:** `export GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`
            *   **Windows (cmd):** `set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
            *   **Windows (PowerShell):** `$env:GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`
        *   Modify the script to read the key from the environment:
            ```python
            import os
            # Replace the deleted line with this:
            GEMINI_API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
            if not GEMINI_API_KEY:
                raise ValueError("Gemini API Key not found. Set the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable.")

            genai.configure(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
            ```

## Usage

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python run_cleaned.py
